   ### Bugs
   Solved bugs

   * When I opened my project on github i went to open my navbar and use the links to naviagte through the
            page but Get a quote and contact werent working.

   * I Figured out that my links never had the # in front of them to link with the div's id.

   * Adding the symbol # to link the id fixed the problem.
